export const RememberTodoProjectCont = `This SPA required a lot of time and deep research to implement. It is my first true deep dive in to a full stack application. It is hosted on Vercel (client) and Heroku (server). I hope you may find it useful to you as much as my family and friends did... They loved it!`;

export const RememberTodoPurpose = `This project included 4 phases and iterations of the site. Phase 1 simply creating the front-end UI structure and elements with and storing the to dos created within memory.
Phase 2 was much larger as it involved storing the user information within local storage and extending it to allow for user sign ups and sign ins. 
`;

export const RememberTodoPurposeCont = `Phase 3 was storing the data and processing it on a local server 
and allowing for the frontend to consume the data from the locally created API. Phase 4 and most difficult was establishing a completely online service where the backend of the app is hosted on Heroku and the frontend on Vercel then connecting the two for a convenient and quick user experience.`;

export const RememberTodoStack = `Using CRA (Create React App) seemed like the clearest choice for this web app. As it is an SPA that utilizes graphQL/Apollo to connect to a hosted MongoDB database. Typescript
 was chosen for its ability to give the project type-safety and to ensure future iterations are more robust and quick. `;
export const RememberTodoStackCont = `React hooks, custom hooks, local storage, graphQL and mongooseJS safety features were used throughout the app to maintain a smooth user experience. This allowed 
for a more robust design. In the future there will be unit test implementations to further push the scope robustness on this app. The apps backend was deployed on Heroku allowing for continuous redeploys
and updates. The frontend is hosted on  Vercel for it's simplicity, speed and reliability.`;
export const RememberTodoProblems = `Like most projects, I ran into a few bumps whilst implementing this app, one particular issue was ensuring code readability and ease of access for user. This project
was my first big app undertaking and it really provided me with a better sense for what is important to a user and to a fellow engineering using my app.`;
export const RememberTodoProblemsCont = `After learning more and more about my issues within this app I have grown incredibly, and understood not only my perspective but others as well. I have made a bigger
effort to ensure my code is more readable and reusable and utilized props and state in many places reducing repeated code.`;
export const RememberTodoLessons = `There are so many many things I have learnt doing this app, it is my first big react app. I struggled a great deal with many new concepts but I did it because I am fascinated with
creating unique things that others can use and provide value for them. `;
export const RememberTodoLessonsCont = `Concepts like Hooks, Git management, API construction and integration and many more pushed me to research and test through night and day. I have learnt many important
lessons and they will push me to be a better engineer.`;
